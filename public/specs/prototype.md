## Cycle Planning

We are going to build a kanban-style board for planning our cycles:

- The user selects how many weeks the cycle will last from a.
- The user selects what weight units the cycle will use. The options are pounds
  or kilograms.
- The user names the cycle.
- The user creates days of the week (columns) then select a label or name for
  each.
- The user can delete a day.
- The user cna change the label.
- Each day (column) contains muscle groups (cards).
- The user creates groups (cards) for each day (column) then selects an exercise
  of the given type (muscle group). Only one exercise per card.
- Once all days have groups and all groups have exercises, the user can create a
  cycle.
